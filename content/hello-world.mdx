I've been planning to start writing and blogging for some time now.
I myself really enjoy reading long-form by others on the internet. Authors like [Scott Galloway](https://www.profgalloway.com/), [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/) and [Naval Ravikant](https://nav.al/rich) are a few of the authors that made a lasting impression on me. And of course the many dozen software engineering-related blogs I revisit frequently*. It's something very special to tap into someone's experience, expertise and ideas in the written form. Many taught me not just valuable lessons but also changed my way of thinking.

At the same time, writing for yourself is such a powerful tool because writing improves your thinking. I often time catch myself in believing that I've come up with a great idea or a smart train of thought but when trying to articulate it or write it down, the output isn't as waterproof or as easy to follow as I originally thought.  

So, starting to blog is both an exercise for my mind and the pursuit of sharing thoughts and ideas that others might find useful.

Here we go. Thanks for reading!
