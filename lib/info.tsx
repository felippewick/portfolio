      I'm a self-taught javascript developer. I started out building for mobile
      and shipped my first app - upto - to the app stores in 2022. I develop
      with react-native & expo for mobile and react & nextjs for the web.
      <br />
      <br />
      My passion for programming got started after few stints in Berlin-based
      startups in both Product and Solutions Engineering. I'm currently doubling
      down on becoming a full-fledged Product Engineer with strong capabilities
      in Design. I'm working on improving the latter every day.
